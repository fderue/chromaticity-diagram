      <h2>Why am I interested in this diagram?</h2>

      <p>
        As a photography enthusiast, I wanted to invest in a high-quality
        monitor for photo editing. Naturally, I turned to Google and searched
        for
        <i>Best monitor for photo editing</i>. I assumed that the most important
        factor for photography was a monitor that could accurately reproduce
        colors as they appear in real life. But which specifications truly
        matter? I had often come across the term <i>color gamut coverage</i>,
        but I never fully understood it. Specifications like <i>98% sRGB</i> or
        <i>95% AdobeRGB</i> appeared frequently, and while it was clear that
        higher percentages were better, I wanted to dive deeper. What do these
        values actually represent? When researching color gamut, sRGB, and
        AdobeRGB, I repeatedly encountered this diagram, called the
        <span class="highlight">CIE 1931 xy-chromaticity diagram</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Determined to finally demystify this diagram, I embarked on an in-depth
        investigation. This article is the result of my findings. By the end,
        you'll be able to answer these questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the chromaticity diagram?</li>
        <li>What is it used for?</li>
        <li>Where does it come from?</li>
        <li>How was it created?</li>
      </ul>
      Let's dive in!

      <h3>The short story</h3>

      <p>
        What is a chromaticity diagram? I would quickly describe the
        chromaticity diagram as a representation of the
        <span class="highlight">Human Visual Gamut</span>, the full range of
        colors that the human eye can perceive. But then you would ask me: all
        the colors? but I don't see the grey? neither the brown nor the
        burgundy? and why would a color have a (x, y) coordinate? Does it mean
        you could represent mathematically a color? Then I would try to be more
        specific: Consider that a color could be fully characterized by two
        attributes: its <span class="highlight">chromaticity</span> and its
        <span class="highlight">luminance</span>. The chromaticity diagram
        represents <i>only</i> the chromaticity of the Human Visual Gamut,
        ignoring luminance. For example, the white point in this diagram has a
        chromaticity of (x = 0.33, y = 0.33), but its luminance isn't
        represented.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this short explanation does not satisfy you, I invite you to keep
        reading and start by asking yourself a simple question: what is a color?
      </p>

      <h2>What is a color? Color vs Wavelength</h2>

      <p>
        You've probably learned in physics class that light is an
        electromagnetic wave, and the portion visible to the human eye falls
        within the wavelength range of approximately 380 nm to 750 nm. You've
        likely seen a diagram illustrating this visible spectrum, where violet
        appears at the shortest wavelengths (~380 nm) and red at the longest
        (~750 nm).
      </p>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img
          src="https://www.datacolor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/electromagnetic-spectrum.jpg"
          alt="visible spectrum"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Each wavelength in this range seems to correspond to a specific color.
        But here's an interesting question: Does this mean that every color we
        perceive can be produced by an electromagnetic wave with a specific
        wavelength? In other words, if you could generate a light with
        electromagnetic waves at any wavelength and any intensity, would you
        find one that corresponds to pink? Let's test this idea with a simple
        simulation. Try matching those patch colors:
      </p>
      <div id="anim-patch-color-match"></div>
      <p>
        Not possible right? That brings us to an important conclusion: not every
        color we perceive can be produced by a light of a single wavelength. A
        light composed of a single wavelength is called
        <span class="highlight">monochromatic light</span> . The colors produced
        by monochromatic light belong to a group known as the
        <span class="highlight"> spectral colors</span>. But what happens when
        we mix multiple monochromatic lights? We get
        <span class="highlight">polychromatic light</span>. And this is how we
        get the other colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        A perfect example is sunlight, which is a polychromatic light made up of
        all the wavelengths in the visible spectrum. You've probably seen this
        in action with a prism experiment, where white light is split into the
        different spectral colors.
      </p>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img
          src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E_UA_azVIAAj1Ae.jpg"
          alt="a prism decomposes sunlight into its spectral colors"
        />
      </div>
      <h3>Spectral Power Distribution (SPD)</h3>
      <p>
        Now, imagine we have a device—similar to a prism that not only
        decomposes light into its individual monochromatic components but also
        measures the amount of energy carried by each wavelength. Good news:
        such a tool exists, and it's called a
        <span class="highlight">spectrometer</span>! The spectrometer's measures
        allows to create a graph known as the
        <span class="highlight">Spectral Power Distribution (SPD)</span>, which
        shows the <span class="highlight">flux density Φ(λ) [W/nm]</span> at
        each wavelength. Here are some exemple of SPD.
      </p>

      <div id="anim-spd"></div>
      <p>
        We might imagine that to create a color from its SPD, we could combine
        all the monochromatic lights of the visible spectrum, adjusting their
        intensities according to the SPD. However, this approach is impractical
        for two main reasons: first, pure monochromatic light does not truly
        exist, and second, we would need an infinite number of such lights.
        There must be an easier way!
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's take a classical color as the yellow. As seen in the visual
        spectrum, it seems to correspond to the spectral color at about 575nm.
        But you've also known your whole life that you could mix red and green
        to get yellow. So it seems we could create yellow in two different ways:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Using a monochromatic light at 575nm.</li>
        <li>
          Combining two monochromatic lights: a red one at 650nm and a green one
          at 545nm.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        On the graph below, you can visualize the SPD of the the monochromatic
        light yellow being a peak at 575nm and the SPD of the combined red and
        green having a peak at 650 and 545 nm.
      </p>
      <div id="anim-spd-yellow"></div>
      <p>
        So two different SPD but the same color! At this point, you might wonder
        🤔: "Maybe it's not two different SPD because if we mix two wavelengths,
        it could create a single monochromatic wavelength that corresponds to
        their sum?" Not quite! For one, wavelengths don't add up like numbers:
        if you recall some trigonometry, adding two sinusoidal waves doesn't
        simply result in another sine wave of their summed wavelength. Plus,
        even if you wanted to add the wavelength of the green and red, it would
        not give the wavelength of yellow (545nm(green) + 650nm(red) ≠
        575nm(yellow)).
      </p>
      <p>
        This brings us to an important concept: light of different SPD can have
        the same color! This phenomenon is called
        <span class="highlight">Metamerism</span>. Metamerism is the phenomenon
        where two different light sources, with different SPDs, are perceived as
        the same color by the human eye. Perhaps, instead of defining color
        based on the physical properties of light, we should focus more on how
        the human eye perceives it.
      </p>
      <h3>Trichromatic Vision</h3>
      <p>
        In the early 1800s, Thomas Young proposed a groundbreaking idea: the
        human eye has <span class="highlight">three types of receptors</span>,
        each sensitive to a different range of wavelengths—corresponding roughly
        to red, green, and blue light. This meant that color perception is
        determined by how these receptors respond to incoming light. Yes, you've
        guessed it, these receptors are what we now call
        <span class="highlight">cones</span>! Since different light spectra can
        produce the same cone response, this explains metamerism, why different
        SPDs can result in the same perceived color. In a few words,
      </p>
      <div id="color-definition">A color is a specific cone response.</div>
      <p>
        As a qualitative example of cone response, imagine looking at blue
        light. The first and second types of cones would show low sensitivity,
        while the third type would have high sensitivity. Later, you'll see that
        we can represent cone responses as a triplet of number, for example, a
        blue light might be expressed quantitatively as (0.1, 0.1, 0.9).
      </p>
      <p>
        This was purely based on experiments at the time—scientists in the 1800s
        had no way to physically analyze the eye's cells. But in the 1960s,
        technology finally caught up. Using microspectrophotometry, a technique
        that measures the light absorption of individual cells, researchers
        confirmed the existence of three distinct types of cones:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>L-cones (sensitive to long wavelengths, red-sensitive)</li>
        <li>M-cones (sensitive too medium wavelengths, green-sensitive)</li>
        <li>S-cones (sensitive to short wavelengths, blue-sensitive)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This discovery provided definitive proof of trichromatic vision!</p>
      <p>
        If we can determine the full range of possible cone responses, this
        range corresponds to the complete set of colors humans can perceive,
        also known as the Human Visual Gamut. Yes, this is the same gamut we
        mentioned at the start of this article! Remember, we're working toward
        explaining the chromaticity diagram, which represents the chromaticity
        attribute of each color of the Human Visual Gamut.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here's an important point: the CIE 1931 xy-chromaticity diagram, the
        very diagram we're trying to explain, was created in 1931, before
        scientists could directly measure cone sensitivity. So how did
        researchers determine cone responses and construct a representation of
        the Human Visual Gamut before they had the technology to analyze the
        eye's cells? To answer this, we need to step back into the 1920s, where
        two scientists, John Guild and William Wright, working independently,
        devised a similar way to map human color perception. Their key
        breakthrough came from an experiment known as the
        <span class="highlight">Color Matching Experiment</span>. In the next
        section, we'll break down this experiment and by the end, you'll
        understand key concepts such as: primaries, reference white,
        chromaticity, luminance, color matching functions.
      </p>

      <h2>The Color Matching Experiment</h2>
      <p>
        A natural conclusion of the trichromatic vision theory is that all
        perceivable colors can be created by mixing just three primary colors in
        varying proportions. The Color Matching Experiment was designed to
        determine how humans perceive color by recreating a
        <span class="highlight">test light</span>, a monochromatic light of
        varying wavelength, using a mix of three primary monochromatic lights,
        referred as <span class="highlight">primaries</span>. Here’s how it
        worked:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A participant was shown a test light with a specific wavelength.
        </li>
        <li>
          They were given three primary lights of fixed wavelengths and asked to
          adjust their intensities until the mixed light matched the test light
          as closely as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          This process was repeated for different test wavelengths across the
          visible spectrum.
        </li>
        <li>
          The experiment was conducted with multiple participants, and their
          results were recorded.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Calibration</h3>
      <p>
        Before conducting the actual Color Matching Experiment, the primaries
        needs to be calibrated using a white light, called a
        <span class="highlight">Reference White</span>. But we can't just pick
        any light that looks white, otherwise, others wouldn't be able to
        reproduce the experiment consistently. To ensure standardization,
        scientists use <span class="highlight">Standard Illuminants</span>,
        specific light sources defined by their SPD. These illuminants serve as
        reference white lights for color experiments. Some commonly used
        standard illuminants include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A: typical tungsten-filament light</li>
        <li>D65 (6500K): Approximating daylight</li>
        <li>E: a theoretical Equal-energy illuminant</li>
        <li>NPL: (National Physical Laboratory)</li>
      </ul>
      <div id="anim-spd-illuminant"></div>
      <p>
        What does calibration mean? Calibration is the process of adjusting the
        intensity of the primaries so that their combination matches the
        reference white. For example, at the start of the experiment, let's say
        that we can control the amount of light emitted by each primary by
        setting an amount of power in watt, then we could find that to match the
        reference white, the red primary needs to be set at 60W, the green
        primary at 30W, and the blue primary at 90W. It means that after
        calibration:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One unit of red = 60W</li>
        <li>One unit of green = 30W</li>
        <li>One unit of blue = 90W</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Those units defines a new system to quantify an
        <span class="highlight">amount of primary</span>. Using this new unit
        system, we can say that the sum of one unit of each primary matches the
        reference white.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can try calibrating the primaries yourself using the animation
        below. Adjust each primary until it matches the reference white. Once
        you're satisfied, click <i>Calibrate</i>. The three calibrated values
        Rp, Gp, and Bp will appear. These notations will be used in the
        explanation later on.
      </p>
      <div id="anim-cmexp-calibration"></div>
      <p>
        Now that the system is calibrated, what we want to measure is the
        chromaticity of a color.
      </p>
      <h3>Chromaticity</h3>
      <p>
        In the color matching experiment, what matters is the amount of each
        primary required to match the test light set at a specific wavelength.
        At every wavelength, the participant was asked to change the intensity
        of each primary to match the test light, and the amount of each primary
        was recorded. Mathematically, we could represent this match as an
        equation called the color matching equation:
      </p>

      <div class="block-equation">
        $$\alpha C(\lambda) \triangleq r'(\lambda)\mathcal{R}
        \hat{+}g'(\lambda)\mathcal{G}\hat{+}b'(\lambda)\mathcal{B} $$
      </div>
      with
      <ul>
        <li>
          \(r'(\lambda), g'(\lambda), b'(\lambda)\) the amount of primary
          \(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{B}\) respectively.
        </li>
        <li>\(C(\lambda)\) the color to be matched.</li>
        <li>\(\alpha\) the amount of color \(C(\lambda)\)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Those strange symbol \(\triangleq, \hat{+}\) indicates that they are not
        algebraic operations, but instead <i>physical</i> operations, such as
        the result of mixing light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since there is no unit defined for \(C(\lambda)\), we don't know the
        amount \(\alpha\). But multiplying each side by a factor would actually
        keep the match. It is equivalent to increase the intensity of the test
        light and increase by the same amount each primary by a factor \(s\)
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ s\alpha C(\lambda) \triangleq
        \underbrace{sr'(\lambda)}_{r}\mathcal{R}
        \hat{+}\underbrace{sg'(\lambda)}_g\mathcal{G}\hat{+}\underbrace{sb'(\lambda)}_b\mathcal{B}
        $$
      </div>
      <p>
        Wright wanted to define the equation so that 1 unit of C would
        correspond to an equation where the sum of the coefficients \(r, g, b\)
        equal 1.
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ sr'+sg'+sr' = 1 \\ s = \frac{1}{r'+g'+b'} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        From this definition, the normalized coefficients \(r, g, b\) could be
        computed from the measured amount of primaries \(r', g', b’\).
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ \begin{split} r = \frac{r'}{r'+g'+b'}\\ g = \frac{g'}{r'+g'+b'}\\ b =
        \frac{b'}{r'+g'+b'} \end{split} $$
      </div>
      <p>The equation can be rewritten as</p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ C(\lambda) \triangleq
        r(\lambda)\mathcal{R}\hat{+}g(\lambda)\mathcal{G}\hat{+}b(\lambda)\mathcal{B}
        $$
      </div>
      <p>
        meaning that 1 unit of color C is matched by \(r\) unit of Red, \(g\)
        unit of Green and \(b\) unit of Blue. Remember that \(r, g, b\) are not
        the initial amount found during the experiment, they are normalized
        value so that \(r+g+b = 1\). Those coefficients \((r, g, b)\), computed
        for each wavelength, are called the
        <span class="highlight">chromaticity coefficients</span>.
      </p>
      <div class="callout">
        Now I am going to show you quantitative results. Those are not directly
        the results from Guild and Wright, because they went through different
        iterations of their experience so their results changed along the way.
        Instead, I will show you directly the data that the Commission
        International de l'Éclairage (CIE) finally decided to use to make the
        standard. The primaries used are Red (700nm), Green (546.1nm) and Blue
        (435.8nm). The white reference is the the standard illuminant E.
      </div>
      <p>
        In the animation below, you can see these coefficients represented on a
        2D graph. By hovering over it, you'll directly observe their
        relationship with the experiment. I've used the calibrated value
        \(R_c=60, G_c=30, B_b=90\) from the previous animation. You may notice
        that some spectral colors cannot be matched simply by mixing the three
        primaries. The only way to match them is by adding a
        <i>negative</i> amount of a primary color, which is equivalent to adding
        a positive amount on the test light side, as shown in the animation.

        Now is the time to give a proper definition for chromaticity! As we saw
        earlier, the chromaticity coefficients represent the relative amounts of
        the primaries that, when summed, match a given color. Since these
        coefficients are relative, we can multiply them by the same factor and
        still obtain the same perceived color, but with a different intensity.
        Here, the word <i>color</i> can be misleading. One might argue that blue
        and dark blue are different colors, and that's fair! Instead, we can
        say: Blue and dark blue have different intensities but share the same
        chromaticity. In this context, <i>intensity</i> is a vague term. A more
        intuitive way to describe it might be <i>luminosity</i> or
        <i>brightness</i>, but the most precise term used in color science is
        <i>luminance</i>.We'll explore luminance in the next section but to
        conclude with the chromaticity, here is definition:
      </p>
      <div class="callout">
        The <span class="highlight">chromaticity</span> of a color is the
        relative amount of primaries needed to match a color regardless of its
        luminance. The relative amounts that sum up to one are called the
        chromaticity coefficients.
      </div>
      <p>
        The chromaticity is only one of the two attributes to describe a color.
        The other attribute is the luminance. To fully characterize a color, we
        need both. The chromaticity graph is not enough, we need another graph
        to take into consideration the luminance.
      </p>
      <h3>Luminance</h3>
      <p>
        The luminance describes how bright an object appears. The term luminance
        can be confusing because it has different meanings in photometry and
        radiometry:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Photometric luminance is based on human vision and perception. It
          measures light as seen by the human eye and is expressed in lumens.
        </li>
        <li>
          Radiometric luminance, also called radiance, is a physical measurement
          of energy, independent of human perception. It is measured in watts
          per steradian per square meter (W/sr·m²).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In this article, luminance refers to the photometric luminance.</p>
      <p>
        To illustrate the luminance, let's take a monochromatic red light and a
        monochromatic green light. If both emit the same power (let's say 1
        watt), you might expect them to appear equally bright. But when you look
        at them, the green light appears brighter than the red, even though they
        emit the same amount of energy! This tells us that brightness is a
        relative metric—our eyes perceive some wavelengths as brighter than
        others, even when their physical energy output is identical. Imagine we
        have a monochromatic light source that emits exactly 1 watt of power at
        any given wavelength. Now, if we ask people to compare the brightness of
        different wavelengths, they will likely report that the brightest color
        they perceive is around 570 nm (yellow-green light). Since brightness is
        a relative measure, we can assign a value of 1 to this maximum perceived
        brightness and scale all other brightness perceptions accordingly. By
        gathering these observations across the entire visible spectrum, we
        obtain a curve known as the
        <span class="highlight">photopic luminosity function V(λ)</span>.
      </p>
      <div id="photopic-graph"></div>
      <p>
        This unit-less curve—derived from human-based experiments based on
        Wright and Guild works—illustrates how our eyes perceive brightness
        under well-lit conditions. So, how does luminance relate to the photopic
        curve?
      </p>
      <p>
        Luminance is computed based on the photopic function V(λ). Therefore, it
        remains a subjective measure—meaning it reflects human visual perception
        rather than an absolute physical quantity. However, unlike raw
        brightness perception, luminance has a unit and can be measured. Given a
        light source having a Spectral Power Distribution (SPD)
        \(\Phi(\lambda)\), its luminance is defined as:
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ L = C_l\int_\lambda \Phi(\lambda)V(\lambda) d\lambda $$
      </div>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          \(C_l=683.002\frac{\mathrm{lm}}{W}\) is a constant that ensures
          luminance is expressed in lumens.
        </li>
        <li>
          The integral sums the weighted contribution of each wavelength,
          according to the human eye's sensitivity V(λ).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To simplify notation, I often omit the constant $C_l$ and express
        luminance in watts instead. The purpose of luminance is to match
        perceived brightness rather than actual emitted power. For example: A
        red light and a green light with equal luminance will appear equally
        bright, even though they may emit different amounts of physical power.
        This makes luminance an essential metric in color science, display
        technology, and lighting design, where human perception matters more
        than raw energy output. Now that we understand what luminance is,
        together with the chromaticity, we can fully describe a color! In the
        next section, we'll modify the trichromatic graph to take into account
        the luminance information of a color. The results are three functions
        called the
        <span class="highlight">Color Matching Functions</span>.
      </p>
      <h3>Color Matching Functions (CMF)</h3>
      <p>
        Remember the 2D graph representing the trichromatic coefficients? It
        allowed us to describe colors independently of luminance, but now, with
        our understanding of luminance, we can enhance this representation to
        fully account for both chromaticity and luminance. To achieve this, we
        introduce in this section three key functions known as the Color
        Matching Functions (CMFs).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Color Matching Experiment, the goal was to match not only the
        chromaticity of a test color but also its luminance. This means that
        when mixing the primary lights, their combined luminance had to be equal
        to the luminance of the test color. When we write
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ C(\lambda) \triangleq
        r(\lambda)\mathcal{R}\hat{+}g(\lambda)\mathcal{G}\hat{+}b(\lambda)\mathcal{B}
        $$
      </div>
      <p>
        using the chromaticity coefficients \(r(\lambda),g(\lambda),b(\lambda)\)
        , this equation only describes the relative amounts of chromaticity, but
        it tells us nothing about luminance. The resulting color C has an
        unknown luminance. We are now looking for an equation that will involve
        the color luminance. To determine the luminance of a color given by
        mixing three primaries, we use Grassmann's Law, which states that: The
        luminance of a color is the sum of the luminance of the individual
        lights that compose it. In other words, when mixing three primary
        lights, the total luminance of the result is simply the sum of their
        individual luminance. Let's pose \(L_r, L_g, L_b\) the luminance of each
        unit of primary \(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{B}\) respectively.
        Let's choose a specific spectral color C of wavelength \(\lambda_C\),
        whose chromaticity coefficients are \(r, g, b\). Mixing the primaries
        according to these chromaticity coefficients would result in a unknown
        luminance \(L_c\). Mathematically,
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ \begin{equation} L_c = rL_r+gL_g+bL_b \end{equation} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        Now let's decide that we want the luminance of a color C that emits one
        1 watt of light. We then have to scale the amount of each primary by the
        same factor $v$ to keep the chromaticity of the color.
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ \begin{equation} \begin{split} L_C^1=v(rL_r+gL_g+bL_b)\\
        =vrL_r+vgL_g+vbL_b\\ \end{split} \end{equation} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        This equation tells us that to match the color C with luminance of 1
        watt, you need to mix \(vr\) amount of \(\mathcal{R}\), $vg$ of
        \(\mathcal{G}\) and $vb$ of \(\mathcal{B}\). So far, here are the
        unknowns : \(v, L_r, L_g, L_b\) We actually know the luminance
        \(L_C^1\). We said that it is the luminance given by 1 Watt of C.
        Remembering the luminance equation
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ L = C_l\int_\lambda \Phi(\lambda)V(\lambda) d\lambda $$
      </div>
      <p>
        If we omit the constant \(C_l\), \(V(\lambda)\) is the known photopic
        curve, and since for a monochromatic light $\lambda_C$ emitting 1 watt,
        its SPD \(\Phi(\lambda) = \delta(\lambda-\lambda_C)\) is just a peak at
        \(\lambda_C\), we can write
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">$$ L_C^1 = V(\lambda_C) $$</div>
      Now we can isolate \(v\)
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ \begin{equation} \begin{split} L_C^1 = V(\lambda_C) =
        v(rL_r+gL_g+bL_b)\\ v = \frac{V(\lambda_c)}{rL_r+gL_g+bL_b} \end{split}
        \end{equation} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        But what are the luminance of one unit of Red, Green, and Blue: \(L_r,
        L_g, L_b\)? Actually, we don't need the absolute luminance values, just
        their relative luminance is needed here. Here is what I mean. Without
        modifying the problem, we could have said that the factor $v$ could
        instead be written as \(v = k\frac{1}{L_r}\). Equation (3) becomes
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ \begin{split} k\frac{1}{L_r} = \frac{V(\lambda_c)}{rL_r+gL_g+bL_b}\\
        \end{split} $$
      </div>
      Now isolating $k$ gives $$
      <div class="block-equation">
        \begin{split} k = \frac{V(\lambda_c)}{\frac{1}{L_r}(rL_r+gL_g+bL_b)}\\
        =\frac{V(\lambda_c)}{(r\frac{L_r}{L_r}+g\frac{L_g}{L_r}+b\frac{L_b}{L_r})}\\
        = \frac{V(\lambda_c)}{(rL^r+gL^ g+bL^b)} \end{split} $$
      </div>
      with
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ \begin{split} L^r = \frac{L_r}{L_r} = 1\\ L^g = \frac{L_g}{L_r}\\ L^b
        = \frac{L_b}{L_r}\\ \end{split} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        This change of variable illustrates that only the relative luminances
        are necessary. Those coefficients \(L^r, L^g, L^b\) are called the
        luminance coefficients. Injecting them in (2) gives this luminance
        equation involving the relative luminances.
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ \begin{equation} \begin{split} L_C^1=v(rL_r+gL_g+bL_b)\\ =
        k\frac{1}{L_r}(rL_r+gL_g+bL_b)\\ = krL^r + kgL_ g + kbL^b \end{split}
        \end{equation} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        But we are still missing \(L^g\) and \(L^b\) ! Wright measured that one
        unit of Green primary was about 4.4 times brighter than one unit of Red
        primary. And that one unit of blue primary was about 0.04 times less
        bright than one unit of Red. The exact value given by CIE are the
        following coefficients. If you are curious on how to find those
        coefficients, here is the <a href="TODO">procedure</a>.
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ L^r = 1 \\ L^g = 4.4036 \\ L^b = 0.0471 $$
      </div>
      Let's generalize equation (4) for any spectral color \(\lambda\),
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} L^1(\lambda)
        &=k(\lambda)r(\lambda)L^r+k(\lambda)g(\lambda)L^g+k(\lambda)b(\lambda)L^b
        \end{aligned} \end{equation} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        which tells us that to match the luminance of 1 watt of a color whose
        chromaticity coefficients are \(r(\lambda), g(\lambda), b(\lambda)\),
        you need
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>\(\bar{r}(\lambda) = k(\lambda)r(\lambda)\) of Red Primary</li>
        <li>\(\bar{g}(\lambda) = k(\lambda)g(\lambda)\) of Green Primary</li>
        <li>\(\bar{b}(\lambda) = k(\lambda)b(\lambda)\) of Blue Primary</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now you have it, the three Color Matching Functions \(\bar{r}(\lambda),
        \bar{g}(\lambda), \bar{b}(\lambda)\). To give a proper definition the
        CMF, \(\bar{r}(\lambda), \bar{g}(\lambda), \bar{b}(\lambda)\) represents
        the amount of Red, Green and Blue primary respectively, needed to match
        the spectral color \(C(\lambda)\) that emits 1 Watt of power. On the
        animation below, you can hover the color matching functions graph to see
        the mathematical relationship with the chromaticity coefficients and the
        photopic luminosity function \(V(\lambda)\).

    </div>

    <div id="anim-chrom2cmf"></div>
    <div class="central-content">
      <p>
        In the next section, we'll see how we can use those function to create
        any
        <span class="highlight">tristimulus values</span>, which are the three
        values used to describe any colors!
      </p>
      <h3>Tristimulus Values</h3>
      <p>
        Why are the CMF important? Remember at the beginning of this article, I
        suggested the idea that to create a color, we could just try to
        reproduce its SPD. I said that it was not realistic to take every
        monochromatic light with a different intensity to try to reproduce the
        SPD. But then we discovered the concept of metamerism. So actually only
        three monochromatic lights are needed to reproduce any colors. We just
        didn't know how to mix them together. Thanks to the CMF, now we know the
        amount of each primary required to match a specific SPD. To reproduce
        any color C (not just a spectral color) having a SPD \(\Phi(\lambda)\),
        the CMF tell us that we need those amount of primary:
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ R=\int{\Phi(\lambda)\bar{r}(\lambda)d\lambda} \\
        G=\int{\Phi(\lambda)\bar{g}(\lambda)d\lambda} \\
        B=\int{\Phi(\lambda)\bar{b}(\lambda)d\lambda} $$
      </div>
      Now, the color C characterized by SPD $\Phi(\lambda)$ is exactly matched
      in chromaticity and luminance by those amounts
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ C \triangleq R\mathcal{R}\hat{+}G\mathcal{G}\hat{+}B\mathcal{B} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        $R, G, B$ are called the tristimulus values of C. The tristimulus R, G,
        B of a color C are the amount of Red, Green and Blue primary
        respectively required to match the color C in chromaticity and
        luminance. Note that the mix R, G, B does not reproduce the SPD of C.
        They create a light whose color is perceived the same as the one of SPD
        \(\Phi(\lambda)\). In the animation below, you can select a color using
        the dropdown menu. You will see how its SPD is multiplied by the CMF.
        The area under each resulting curve represents the tristimulus values.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="anim-tristimulus-from-spd"></div>
    <div class="central-content">
      <p>
        With the tristimulus values, we have found a way to represent
        mathematically any color using three numbers. Remember that we said that
        a color is a specific cone response and that if we could find all the
        cone response, they would compose all the colors a human can perceive,
        i.e the Human Visual Gamut. The R, G, B tristimulus values are those
        cones response! It would be more correct to say that they are the
        attempt of Guild and Wright to represent the cone response. In an other
        chapter, we'll compare the real cone responses (L, M, S) found later by
        scientists to those tristimulus RGB. Since the tristimulus are 3
        numbers, we can use them as dimensions on a 3D graph! Each axis will
        represent the amount of each primary. If you forgot what one unit of R
        primary is, it is the
        <i>look</i> of the Red Primary found during calibration! Our unit system
        is the one decided during calibration.
      </p>
      <h3>Graphical 3D representation of colors</h3>
      <p>
        Let's start to plot the tristimulus of the Spectral Colors corresponding
        of monochromatic lights that emit 1 one watt! Why? because we already
        have those tristimulus values, they are equivalent to the CMF! Remember
        that the CMF values are the amount of primary needed to match a
        monochromatic light emitting one watt. Mathematically, you could express
        the SPD of monochromatic light as dirac function \(\Phi(\lambda) =
        P_0\delta(\lambda-\lambda_0)\), with P0=1 watt. Therefore the
        tristimulus value of a monochromatic light of wavelength \(\lambda_m\)
        emitting 1 watt are given by
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$
        R_m=\int{\delta(\lambda-\lambda_m)\bar{r}(\lambda)d\lambda}=\bar{r}(\lambda_m)\\
        G_m=\int{\delta(\lambda-\lambda_m)\bar{g}(\lambda)d\lambda}=\bar{g}(\lambda_m)
        \\
        B_m=\int{\delta(\lambda-\lambda_m)\bar{b}(\lambda)d\lambda}=\bar{b}(\lambda_m)
        $$
      </div>
      which mean that for each spectral color, we can take the value of the CMF
      as their tristimulus value. In the animation below, you can hover on each
      wavelength and see their corresponding tristimulus value on the 3d graph.
      <div id="anim-cmf2graph3d"></div>
      <p>
        Fine, now we have the spectral colors, but what about the other colors?
        Remember when we talked about polychromaticity? You can combine
        monochromatic light to create other colors? Then mathematically, we can
        also express it in this 3D graph. Let's take the color Red an Green. If
        you mix half of both, you do the same for their tristimulus value and
        you will have a resulting color C. Name it as you want (maybe yellow?).
        But what your brain will perceive is a linear combination of both of the
        spectral color. On the graph you notice that it almost coincide with the
        yellow spectral color. Yes! Metamerism! In your brain, the response of
        the cones will be similar as the response given by monochromatic yellow
        light! So mixing red and green will give you the same response. But wait
        R, G, B are not the brain response right? You're right, but remember,
        according to the research of Thomas, Guild and Wright thought that each
        cone was more sensitive to one primary color, so they use the primary as
        a way to simulate the cone response. And later, when we were able to
        effectively compute the cone response (we'll talk later about LMS), the
        3D graph will look very similar!!
      </p>
      <p>
        So by combining the monochromatic light with different weights, we are
        able to make the brain perceive other colors and we can plot them in the
        3D graph. There is an infinity of combination possible, but some of them
        will give the same color! Taking two spectral colors and generating all
        the colors in between can already give us many colors, which as we can
        visualize on the animation, will give us an "envelope” of the Human
        Visual Gamut.
      </p>
      <div id="interpolate-tristimulus"></div>
      <p>
        Note that this envelope of generated color from the spectral colors are
        colors that would be perceived by a light emitting 1 watt! If you
        remember the general color matching equation using the tristimulus
        values
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ C \triangleq R\mathcal{R}\hat{+}G\mathcal{G}\hat{+}B\mathcal{B} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        If the luminance correspond to a light emitting 1 one of power, we can
        use the CMF as tristimulus values to write
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ C_1 \triangleq
        \bar{r}\mathcal{R}\hat{+}\bar{g}\mathcal{G}\hat{+}\bar{b}\mathcal{B} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        and for any other luminance $l$, you could simply scale each coefficient
        with the same factor $s$ to keep the same chromaticity
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ C_l = sC_1 \triangleq
        s\bar{r}\mathcal{R}+s\bar{g}\mathcal{G}+s\bar{b}\mathcal{B} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        Varying $s$ will vary the luminance of the color but keep the same
        chromaticity. Graphically, changing the luminance while keeping the
        chromaticity boils down to moving the tristimulus values on the
        <span class="highlight">isochromatic line</span>, a line of constant
        chromaticity.

        Since you can increase the luminance indefinitely, there is actually no
        boundaries to be able to represent the Human Visual Gamut. The cone
        shape envelope we see is only a representation of equal-energy colors.
        However, the chromaticity of the Human Visual has boundaries. You'll
        better visualize those boundaries in the next section but we can already
        understand that because of those defined boundaries, we use the
        chromaticity diagram as a representation of the Human Visual Gamut.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we could say that the 3d volume is one sample of the Human Visual
        Gamut in a 3D space where each axis represent the amount of a primary
        light composing a color. Remember that the data I used are from the CIE.
        The actual primaries used for this representation are the Red at 700nm,
        Green at 546.1nm and Blue at 435.8nm. And the sum of one unit of each
        primary will match the reference white E. Those primaries and reference
        white defined the 3D color space called the
        <span class="highlight">CIE 1931 RGB color space</span> (which is still
        neither the sRgb nor AdobeRGB color space!)

      <h3>Color Matching Experiment Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Here is a quick recap on the different step of the color matching
        experiment. By asking humans to match the spectral colors, we ended up
        by being able to represent the colors by three tristimulus values in a
        3D in a color space called the CIE1931 RGB color space.

        >: triplet of value representing the amount of primaries needed to
        create a color of a specific SPD. They can be computed from the CMF and
        the SPD of a color. This triplet is a mathematical representation of a
        color. Therefore we can now represent them in a 3D space, which is the
        first color space called the CIE1931 RGB color space.
      </li>

      <p>
        The next question is: how is the CIE1931 color space related to the
        horseshoe-shape chromaticity diagram? It is a 2d graph, not a 3d and the
        axis are x and y, not R, G nor B!
      </p>

      <h2>The Chromaticity Diagram (finally)</h2>
      <p>
        So far we've been able to understand that a color can be represented by
        its chromaticity coefficients and its luminance, and all the color a
        human can perceive are represented in a 3D volume with 3 axes R, G and
        B. Now it's good to recall the relationship between the different
        concepts through their mathematical notation.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>\(r, g, b\) : chromaticity coefficients</li>
        <li>\(\bar{r},\bar{g},\bar{b}\) : Color Matching Functions</li>
        <li>\(R, G, B\) : tristimulus values of a color</li>
        <li>\(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{B}\) : unit of Primary</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A color C represented by its SPD \(\Phi(\lambda)\) is fully matched in
        term of chromaticity and luminance using the tristimulus values:
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ C \triangleq R\mathcal{R}\hat{+}G\mathcal{G}\hat{+}B\mathcal{B} $$
      </div>
      where each tristimulus value are
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ R=\int{\Phi(\lambda)\bar{r}(\lambda)d\lambda} \\
        G=\int{\Phi(\lambda)\bar{g}(\lambda)d\lambda} \\
        B=\int{\Phi(\lambda)\bar{b}(\lambda)d\lambda} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        And from these tristimulus values, we can deduce the chromaticity
        coefficients because they are the relative amount primaries needed to
        produce a certain amount of this color C. In addition, they are defined
        such that their sum = 1.
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ r = \frac{R}{R+G+B} \\ g = \frac{G}{R+G+B} \\ b = 1-r-g $$
      </div>
      <p>
        If we represent the chromaticity coefficients in the RGB space, those
        points $r, g, b$ lies on the plane R+G+B =1, which is equivalent to
        project all the 3D visual gamut points onto this plane, along their line
        of constant chromaticity. By omitting b which can be found using r and
        g, you could visualize this plane in a 2D graph rg. This animation shows
        you the different projections. To make it the animation clearer, only
        the spectral colors are shown.
      </p>
      <div id="anim-RgbFrom3dTo2d"></div>
      <p>
        And there you have it, the chromaticity diagram. But it's still
        different than the one in the introduction! Be patient, we are almost
        there. This chromaticity diagram is expressed in the rg-plane while the
        one we are looking for is in the xy-plane. However, the xy-chromaticity
        diagram is actually the same this rg-chromaticity diagram but coming
        from a other color space created by CIE, the CIE1931 XYZ color space,
        which is a simple linear transformation of the CIE1931 RGB color space.
        Why not use the CIE1931 RGB? Because CIE wanted a standard color space
        where the colors could be expressed only with positive values. On top of
        that, they wanted one of the dimensions to represent the luminance.
      </p>
      <h3>From CIE1931 RGB to CIE1931 XYZ</h3>
      <p>
        Remembering a bit of linear algebra, you know that to transform the
        coordinates of a point into another coordinate system, you need a
        transformation matrix that maps the axis of one of the system to the
        other one. Mathematically, the tristimulus values (R, G, B) in the RGB
        space defined by the three axis $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G},
        \mathcal{B})$ (the primaries) system can be expressed in the coordinate
        system defined by three other
        axis\(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y},\mathcal{Z}\) and have coordinate (X, Y,
        Z).
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ \begin{bmatrix} X \\ Y \\ Z \end{bmatrix} = M \begin{bmatrix} R \\ G
        \\ B \end{bmatrix} $$
      </div>
      with
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ M = \begin{bmatrix} 0.49 & 0.31 & 0.20 \\ 0.17697 & 0.81240 & 0.01063
        \\ 0.00 & 0.01 & 0.99 \end{bmatrix} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        How did we find this matrix? and how was this new coordinate system X,
        Y, Z chosen? You'll find all the details <a href="">here</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The important point is that in this new system, all tristimulus values
        will be positive and the Y component represents the luminance of the
        color. In the XYZ space using primaries
        \(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y},\mathcal{Z}\), a color (chromaticity and
        luminance) of coordinates \((X, Y,Z)\) is now expressed as
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ C \triangleq X\mathcal{X}\hat{+}Y\mathcal{Y}\hat{+}Z\mathcal{Z} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        And again, the chromaticity coefficients are the relative amount of
        primaries chosen such that their sum = 1.
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ x = \frac{X}{X+Y+Z} \\ y = \frac{Y}{X+Y+Z} \\ z = 1-x-y $$
      </div>
      <p>
        Similarly as we did in the CIE1931 RGB space, we can plot the (X, Y, Z)
        tristimulus values simply by transforming the tristimulus (R, G, B)
        thanks to the matrix M.
      </p>
      <p>
        if we project those points along their line of isochromaticity on the
        plane X+Y+Z=1, we obtain the chromaticity coefficients (x, y, z). Then
        by omitting z which is dependent of x and y, we obtain on the XY-plane
        the famous horseshoe shape diagram. If we transfer those coordinates in
        a 2d graph with x and y label, we finally obtain our
        <span class="highlight">xy-chromaticity diagram</span>!
      </p>
      <div id="anim-cieRGBtoXYZ"></div>
      <p>
        Remember I've only projected the spectral colors, this is why the
        chromaticity diagram seems "empty”. This projection draws the boundaries
        of the chromaticity diagram and is called the
        <span class="highlight">spectral locus</span>. If we would have taken
        more points in the 3d volume we would have had more points and the shape
        would start to fill in. But we can also work directly on the 2d
        chromaticity diagram itself. To add more chromaticity we need to
        generate other colors. As seen previously (when filling the volume
        between two colors), mixing colors to produce an other color consists in
        summing up their tristimulus value.
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ \begin{split} C_1 \triangleq X_1\mathcal{X} \hat{+} Y_1\mathcal{Y}
        \hat{+} Z_1\mathcal{Z}\\ C_2 \triangleq X_2\mathcal{X} \hat{+}
        Y_2\mathcal{Y} \hat{+} Z_2\mathcal{Z}\\ C_r \triangleq C_1+C_2
        \triangleq \underbrace{(X_1+X_2)}_{X_r}\mathcal{X}
        \hat{+}\underbrace{(Y_1+Y_2)}_{Y_r}\mathcal{Y} \hat{+}
        \underbrace{(Z_1+Z_2)}_{Z_r}\mathcal{Z}\\ \end{split} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        During this addition, what happens to the chromaticity coefficients. Do
        they also add up? Let's take the x chromaticity coordinate.
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ \begin{split} x_r &= \frac{X_r}{X_r+Y_r+Z_r}\\ &=
        \frac{X_1+X_2}{X_1+X_2+Y_1+Y_2+Z_1+Z_2} \end{split} $$
      </div>
      Using the chromaticity of C1 and C2,
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ X_1 = x_1(X_1+Y_1+Z_1)\\ X_2 = x_2(X_2+Y_2+Z_2) $$
      </div>
      Substituting in (…), and posing \(L_1 = (X_1+Y_1+Z_1)\) and
      \(L_2=(X_2+Y_2+Z_2)\), we end up with
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ \begin{split} x_r = \frac{X_r}{X_r+Y_r+Z_r} = \frac{L_1x_1 +
        L_2x_2}{L_1+L_2} \end{split} $$
      </div>
      This equation show the relation between the chromaticities. When mixing
      two colors, the resulting chromaticity is a weighted sum of their
      respective chromaticity.
      <p>
        Now, back to our chromaticity diagram. Remember that it is a projection
        of the plane X+Y+Z = 1. Therefore, to represent the chromaticity of
        \(C_r\), we have to constraint \(L_1+L_2 = 1\). We can rewrite equation
        (…) with this constraint and do the same development for the
        y-coordinate.
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ \begin{split} x_r = L_1x_1 + (1-L_1)x_2\\ y_r = L_1y_1 + (1-L_1)y_2
        \end{split} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        According to this equation, if you take two color on the spectral locus
        and you combine them, the line in between represent the chromaticity of
        the colors resulting in mixing the spectral colors with different
        amount. Here an animation illustrating this computation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chromaticities between minLambda and maxLambda which close the shape
        is called the line of purple! It's not part of the spectral locus since
        those colors does not correspond spectral colors. Each point inside this
        shape has coordinate (x, y) and represent the chromaticity of a colors.
        Since multiple colors have the same chromaticity, you could arbitraly
        decide which colors of chormaticity (x, y) you want plot. Usually, we
        use the color with the maximum luminance possible given by your device.
      </p>
      <h3>Playing with chromaticity and luminance</h3>
      <p>
        Remember that a color can be characterized by its two attributes: its
        chromaticity and its luminance. And now you know that the chromaticity
        is given by the coordinates (x, y) in the chromaticity diagram. And the
        luminance is the Y component in the XYZ color space. In the animation
        below, you can create any color by choosing the chromaticity on the
        diagram and the luminance by changing the Y component. As expected,
        changing the luminance while keeping the same chromaticity will move you
        along the isochromatic line represented in the 3D graph.
