        <h2>Why am I interested in this diagram?</h2>
        <p>
          As a photography enthusiast, I wanted to invest in a high-quality
          monitor for photo editing. Naturally, I turned to Google and searched
          for
          <i>Best monitor for photo editing</i>. I assumed that the most
          important factor for photography was a monitor that could accurately
          reproduce colors as they appear in real life. But which specifications
          truly matter? I had often come across the term
          <i>color gamut coverage</i>, but I never fully understood it.
          Specifications like <i>98% sRGB</i> or <i>95% AdobeRGB</i> appeared
          frequently, and while it was clear that higher percentages were
          better, I wanted to dive deeper. What do these values actually
          represent? When researching color gamut, sRGB, and AdobeRGB, I
          repeatedly encountered this diagram, called the
          <span class="highlight">CIE 1931 xy-chromaticity diagram</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determined to finally demystify this diagram, I embarked on an
          in-depth investigation. This article is the result of my findings. By
          the end, you'll be able to answer these questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is the chromaticity diagram?</li>
          <li>What is it used for?</li>
          <li>Where does it come from?</li>
          <li>How was it created?</li>

        <h3>The short story</h3>
        <p>
          What is a chromaticity diagram? I would quickly describe the
          chromaticity diagram as a representation of the
          <span class="highlight">Human Visual Gamut</span>, the full range of
          colors that the human eye can perceive. But then you would ask me: all
          the colors? but I don't see the grey? neither the brown nor the
          burgundy? and why would a color have a (x, y) coordinate? Does it mean
          you could represent mathematically a color? Then I would try to be
          more specific: Consider that a color could be fully characterized by
          two attributes: its <span class="highlight">chromaticity</span> and
          its <span class="highlight">luminance</span>. The chromaticity diagram
          represents <i>only</i> the chromaticity of the Human Visual Gamut,
          ignoring luminance. For example, the white point in this diagram has a
          chromaticity of (x = 0.33, y = 0.33), but its luminance isn't
          represented.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this short explanation does not satisfy you, I invite you to keep
          reading and start by asking yourself a simple question: what is a
          color?

        <h2>What is a color? Color vs Wavelength</h2>

        <p>
          You've probably learned in physics class that light is an
          electromagnetic wave, and the portion visible to the human eye falls
          within the wavelength range of approximately 380 nm to 750 nm. You've
          likely seen a diagram illustrating this visible spectrum, where violet
          appears at the shortest wavelengths (~380 nm) and red at the longest
          (~750 nm).
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
          <img
            src="https://www.datacolor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/electromagnetic-spectrum.jpg"

          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Each wavelength in this range seems to correspond to a specific color.
          But here's an interesting question: Does this mean that every color we
          perceive can be produced by an electromagnetic wave with a specific
          wavelength? In other words, if you could generate a light with
          electromagnetic waves at any wavelength and any intensity, would you
          find one that corresponds to pink? Let's test this idea with a simple
          simulation. Try matching those patch colors:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="anim-patch-color-match" class="full-width-animation"></div>
      <div class="central-content">
        <p>
          Not possible right? That brings us to an important conclusion: not
          every color we perceive can be produced by a light of a single
          wavelength. A light composed of a single wavelength is called
          <span class="highlight">monochromatic light</span> . The colors
          produced by monochromatic light belong to a group known as the
          <span class="highlight"> spectral colors</span>. But what happens when
          we mix multiple monochromatic lights? We get
          <span class="highlight">polychromatic light</span>. And this is how we
          get the other colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          A perfect example is sunlight, which is a polychromatic light made up
          of all the wavelengths in the visible spectrum. You've probably seen
          this in action with a prism experiment, where white light is split
          into the different spectral colors.

          <h3>Spectral Power Distribution (SPD)</h3>
          <p>
            Now, imagine we have a device—similar to a prism that not only
            decomposes light into its individual monochromatic components but
            also measures the amount of energy carried by each wavelength. Good
            news: such a tool exists, and it's called a
            <span class="highlight">spectrometer</span>! The spectrometer's
            measures allows to create a graph known as the
            <span class="highlight">Spectral Power Distribution (SPD)</span>,
            which shows the
            <span class="highlight">flux density Φ(λ) [W/nm]</span> at each
            wavelength. Here are some exemple of SPD.
          </p>

          <div id="anim-spd"></div>
          <p>
            We might imagine that to create a color from its SPD, we could
            combine all the monochromatic lights of the visible spectrum,
            adjusting their intensities according to the SPD. However, this
            approach is impractical for two main reasons: first, pure
            monochromatic light does not truly exist, and second, we would need
            an infinite number of such lights. There must be an easier way!
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's take a classical color as the yellow. As seen in the visual
            spectrum, it seems to correspond to the spectral color at about
            575nm. But you've also known your whole life that you could mix red
            and green to get yellow. So it seems we could create yellow in two
            different ways:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Using a monochromatic light at 575nm.</li>
            <li>
              Combining two monochromatic lights: a red one at 650nm and a green
              one at 545nm.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            On the graph below, you can visualize the SPD of the the
            monochromatic light yellow being a peak at 575nm and the SPD of the
            combined red and green having a peak at 650 and 545 nm.
          </p>
          <div id="anim-spd-yellow"></div>
          <p>
            So two different SPD but the same color! At this point, you might
            wonder 🤔: "Maybe it's not two different SPD because if we mix two
            wavelengths, it could create a single monochromatic wavelength that
            corresponds to their sum?" Not quite! For one, wavelengths don't add
            up like numbers: if you recall some trigonometry, adding two
            sinusoidal waves doesn't simply result in another sine wave of their
            summed wavelength. Plus, even if you wanted to add the wavelength of
            the green and red, it would not give the wavelength of yellow
            (545nm(green) + 650nm(red) ≠ 575nm(yellow)).
          </p>
          <p>
            This brings us to an important concept: light of different SPD can
            have the same color! This phenomenon is called
            <span class="highlight">Metamerism</span>. Metamerism is the
            phenomenon where two different light sources, with different SPDs,
            are perceived as the same color by the human eye. Perhaps, instead
            of defining color based on the physical properties of light, we
            should focus more on how the human eye perceives it.

          <h3>Trichromatic Vision</h3>
          <p>
            In the early 1800s, Thomas Young proposed a groundbreaking idea: the
            human eye has
            <span class="highlight">three types of receptors</span>, each
            sensitive to a different range of wavelengths—corresponding roughly
            to red, green, and blue light. This meant that color perception is
            determined by how these receptors respond to incoming light. Yes,
            you've guessed it, these receptors are what we now call
            <span class="highlight">cones</span>! Since different light spectra
            can produce the same cone response, this explains metamerism, why
            different SPDs can result in the same perceived color. In a few
            words,
          </p>
          <div id="color-definition">A color is a specific cone response.</div>
          <p>
            As a qualitative example of cone response, imagine looking at blue
            light. The first and second types of cones would show low
            sensitivity, while the third type would have high sensitivity.
            Later, you'll see that we can represent cone responses as a triplet
            of number, for example, a blue light might be expressed
            quantitatively as (0.1, 0.1, 0.9).
          </p>
          <p>
            This was purely based on experiments at the time—scientists in the
            1800s had no way to physically analyze the eye's cells. But in the
            1960s, technology finally caught up. Using microspectrophotometry, a
            technique that measures the light absorption of individual cells,
            researchers confirmed the existence of three distinct types of
            cones:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>L-cones (sensitive to long wavelengths, red-sensitive)</li>
            <li>M-cones (sensitive too medium wavelengths, green-sensitive)</li>
            <li>S-cones (sensitive to short wavelengths, blue-sensitive)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This discovery provided definitive proof of trichromatic vision!
          </p>
          <p>
            If we can determine the full range of possible cone responses, this
            range corresponds to the complete set of colors humans can perceive,
            also known as the Human Visual Gamut. Yes, this is the same gamut we
            mentioned at the start of this article! Remember, we're working
            toward explaining the chromaticity diagram, which represents the
            chromaticity attribute of each color of the Human Visual Gamut.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's an important point: the CIE 1931 xy-chromaticity diagram,
            the very diagram we're trying to explain, was created in 1931,
            before scientists could directly measure cone sensitivity. So how
            did researchers determine cone responses and construct a
            representation of the Human Visual Gamut before they had the
            technology to analyze the eye's cells? To answer this, we need to
            step back into the 1920s, where two scientists, John Guild and
            William Wright, working independently, devised a similar way to map
            human color perception. Their key breakthrough came from an
            experiment known as the
            <span class="highlight">Color Matching Experiment</span>. In the
            next section, we'll break down this experiment and by the end,
            you'll understand key concepts such as: primaries, reference white,
            chromaticity, luminance, color matching functions.

      <h2>The Color Matching Experiment</h2>
      <p>
        A natural conclusion of the trichromatic vision theory is that all
        perceivable colors can be created by mixing just three primary colors in
        varying proportions. The Color Matching Experiment was designed to
        determine how humans perceive color by recreating a
        <span class="highlight">test light</span>, a monochromatic light of
        varying wavelength, using a mix of three primary monochromatic lights,
        referred as <span class="highlight">primaries</span>. Here’s how it
        worked:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A participant was shown a test light with a specific wavelength.
        </li>
        <li>
          They were given three primary lights of fixed wavelengths and asked to
          adjust their intensities until the mixed light matched the test light
          as closely as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          This process was repeated for different test wavelengths across the
          visible spectrum.
        </li>
        <li>
          The experiment was conducted with multiple participants, and their
          results were recorded.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <section id="calibration">
        <h3>Calibration</h3>
        <p>
          Before conducting the actual Color Matching Experiment, the primaries
          needs to be calibrated using a white light, called a
          <span class="highlight">Reference White</span>. But we can't just pick
          any light that looks white, otherwise, others wouldn't be able to
          reproduce the experiment consistently. To ensure standardization,
          scientists use <span class="highlight">Standard Illuminants</span>,
          specific light sources defined by their SPD. These illuminants serve
          as reference white lights for color experiments. Some commonly used
          standard illuminants include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A: typical tungsten-filament light</li>
          <li>D65 (6500K): Approximating daylight</li>
          <li>E: a theoretical Equal-energy illuminant</li>
          <li>NPL: (National Physical Laboratory)</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="anim-spd-illuminant"></div>
        <p>
          What does calibration mean? Calibration is the process of adjusting
          the intensity of the primaries so that their combination matches the
          reference white. For example, at the start of the experiment, let's
          say that we can control the amount of light emitted by each primary by
          setting an amount of power in watt, then we could find that to match
          the reference white, the red primary needs to be set at 60W, the green
          primary at 30W, and the blue primary at 90W. It means that after
          calibration:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>One unit of red = 60W</li>
          <li>One unit of green = 30W</li>
          <li>One unit of blue = 90W</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Those units defines a new system to quantify an
          <span class="highlight">amount of primary</span>. Using this new unit
          system, we can say that the sum of one unit of each primary matches
          the reference white.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can try calibrating the primaries yourself using the animation
          below. Adjust each primary until it matches the reference white. Once
          you're satisfied, click <i>Calibrate</i>. The three calibrated values
          Rp, Gp, and Bp will appear. These notations will be used in the
          explanation later on.
        </p>
        <div id="anim-cmexp-calibration"></div>
        <p>
          Now that the system is calibrated, what we want to measure is the
          chromaticity of a color.

        <h3>Chromaticity</h3>
        <p>
          In the color matching experiment, what matters is the amount of each
          primary required to match the test light set at a specific wavelength.
          At every wavelength, the participant was asked to change the intensity
          of each primary to match the test light, and the amount of each
          primary was recorded. Mathematically, we could represent this match as
          an equation called the color matching equation:
        </p>

        <div class="block-equation">
          $$\alpha C(\lambda) \triangleq r'(\lambda)\mathcal{R}
          \hat{+}g'(\lambda)\mathcal{G}\hat{+}b'(\lambda)\mathcal{B} $$
        </div>
        with
        <ul>
          <li>
            \(r'(\lambda), g'(\lambda), b'(\lambda)\) the amount of primary
            \(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{B}\) respectively.
          </li>

          along the way. Instead, I will show you directly the data that the
          Commission International de l'Éclairage (CIE) finally decided to use
          to make the standard. The primaries used are Red (700nm), Green

          Now is the time to give a proper definition for chromaticity! As we
          saw earlier, the chromaticity coefficients represent the relative
          amounts of the primaries that, when summed, match a given color. Since
          these coefficients are relative, we can multiply them by the same
          factor and still obtain the same perceived color, but with a different
          intensity. Here, the word <i>color</i> can be misleading. One might
          argue that blue and dark blue are different colors, and that's fair!
          Instead, we can say: Blue and dark blue have different intensities but
          share the same chromaticity. In this context, <i>intensity</i> is a
          vague term. A more intuitive way to describe it might be
          <i>luminosity</i> or <i>brightness</i>, but the most precise term used
          in color science is <i>luminance</i>.We'll explore luminance in the
          next section but to conclude with the chromaticity, here is
          definition:
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          The <span class="highlight">chromaticity</span> of a color is the
          relative amount of primaries needed to match a color regardless of its
          luminance. The relative amounts that sum up to one are called the
          chromaticity coefficients.
        </div>
        <p>
          The chromaticity is only one of the two attributes to describe a
          color. The other attribute is the luminance. To fully characterize a
          color, we need both. The chromaticity graph is not enough, we need
          another graph to take into consideration the luminance.

        <h3>Luminance</h3>
        <p>
          The luminance describes how bright an object appears. The term
          luminance can be confusing because it has different meanings in
          photometry and radiometry:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Photometric luminance is based on human vision and perception. It
            measures light as seen by the human eye and is expressed in lumens.
          </li>
          <li>
            Radiometric luminance, also called radiance, is a physical
            measurement of energy, independent of human perception. It is
            measured in watts per steradian per square meter (W/sr·m²).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this article, luminance refers to the photometric luminance.</p>
        <p>
          To illustrate the luminance, let's take a monochromatic red light and
          a monochromatic green light. If both emit the same power (let's say 1
          watt), you might expect them to appear equally bright. But when you
          look at them, the green light appears brighter than the red, even
          though they emit the same amount of energy! This tells us that
          brightness is a relative metric—our eyes perceive some wavelengths as
          brighter than others, even when their physical energy output is
          identical. Imagine we have a monochromatic light source that emits
          exactly 1 watt of power at any given wavelength. Now, if we ask people
          to compare the brightness of different wavelengths, they will likely
          report that the brightest color they perceive is around 570 nm
          (yellow-green light). Since brightness is a relative measure, we can
          assign a value of 1 to this maximum perceived brightness and scale all
          other brightness perceptions accordingly. By gathering these
          observations across the entire visible spectrum, we obtain a curve
          known as the
          <span class="highlight">photopic luminosity function V(λ)</span>.
        </p>
        <div id="photopic-graph"></div>
        <p>
          This unit-less curve—derived from human-based experiments based on
          Wright and Guild works—illustrates how our eyes perceive brightness
          under well-lit conditions. So, how does luminance relate to the
          photopic curve?
        </p>
        <p>
          Luminance is computed based on the photopic function V(λ). Therefore,
          it remains a subjective measure—meaning it reflects human visual
          perception rather than an absolute physical quantity. However, unlike
          raw brightness perception, luminance has a unit and can be measured.
          Given a light source having a Spectral Power Distribution (SPD)
          \(\Phi(\lambda)\), its luminance is defined as:
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ L = C_l\int_\lambda \Phi(\lambda)V(\lambda) d\lambda $$
        </div>
        where
        <ul>
          <li>
            \(C_l=683.002\frac{\mathrm{lm}}{W}\) is a constant that ensures
            luminance is expressed in lumens.
          </li>
          <li>
            The integral sums the weighted contribution of each wavelength,
            according to the human eye's sensitivity V(λ).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To simplify notation, I often omit the constant $C_l$ and express
          luminance in watts instead. The purpose of luminance is to match
          perceived brightness rather than actual emitted power. For example: A
          red light and a green light with equal luminance will appear equally
          bright, even though they may emit different amounts of physical power.
          This makes luminance an essential metric in color science, display
          technology, and lighting design, where human perception matters more
          than raw energy output. Now that we understand what luminance is,
          together with the chromaticity, we can fully describe a color! In the
          next section, we'll modify the trichromatic graph to take into account
          the luminance information of a color. The results are three functions
          called the
          <span class="highlight">Color Matching Functions</span>.

      <section id="color-matching-function">
        <h3>Color Matching Functions (CMF)</h3>
        <p>
          Remember the 2D graph representing the trichromatic coefficients? It
          allowed us to describe colors independently of luminance, but now,
          with our understanding of luminance, we can enhance this
          representation to fully account for both chromaticity and luminance.
          To achieve this, we introduce in this section three key functions
          known as the Color Matching Functions (CMFs).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Color Matching Experiment, the goal was to match not only the
          chromaticity of a test color but also its luminance. This means that
          when mixing the primary lights, their combined luminance had to be
          equal to the luminance of the test color. When we write
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ C(\lambda) \triangleq
          r(\lambda)\mathcal{R}\hat{+}g(\lambda)\mathcal{G}\hat{+}b(\lambda)\mathcal{B}
          $$
        </div>
        <p>
          using the chromaticity coefficients
          \(r(\lambda),g(\lambda),b(\lambda)\) , this equation only describes
          the relative amounts of chromaticity, but it tells us nothing about
          luminance. The resulting color C has an unknown luminance. We are now
          looking for an equation that will involve the color luminance. To
          determine the luminance of a color given by mixing three primaries, we
          use Grassmann's Law, which states that: The luminance of a color is
          the sum of the luminance of the individual lights that compose it. In
          other words, when mixing three primary lights, the total luminance of
          the result is simply the sum of their individual luminance. Let's pose
          \(L_r, L_g, L_b\) the luminance of each unit of primary
          \(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{B}\) respectively. Let's choose a
          specific spectral color C of wavelength \(\lambda_C\), whose
          chromaticity coefficients are \(r, g, b\). Mixing the primaries
          according to these chromaticity coefficients would result in a unknown
          luminance \(L_c\). Mathematically,
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ \begin{equation} L_c = rL_r+gL_g+bL_b \end{equation} $$
        </div>
        <p>
          Now let's decide that we want the luminance of a color C that emits
          one 1 watt of light. We then have to scale the amount of each primary
          by the same factor $v$ to keep the chromaticity of the color.
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ \begin{equation} \begin{split} L_C^1=v(rL_r+gL_g+bL_b)\\
          =vrL_r+vgL_g+vbL_b\\ \end{split} \end{equation} $$
        </div>
        <p>
          This equation tells us that to match the color C with luminance of 1
          watt, you need to mix \(vr\) amount of \(\mathcal{R}\), $vg$ of
          \(\mathcal{G}\) and $vb$ of \(\mathcal{B}\). So far, here are the
          unknowns : \(v, L_r, L_g, L_b\) We actually know the luminance
          \(L_C^1\). We said that it is the luminance given by 1 Watt of C.
          Remembering the luminance equation
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ L = C_l\int_\lambda \Phi(\lambda)V(\lambda) d\lambda $$
        </div>
        <p>
          If we omit the constant \(C_l\), \(V(\lambda)\) is the known photopic
          curve, and since for a monochromatic light $\lambda_C$ emitting 1
          watt, its SPD \(\Phi(\lambda) = \delta(\lambda-\lambda_C)\) is just a
          peak at \(\lambda_C\), we can write
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">$$ L_C^1 = V(\lambda_C) $$</div>
        Now we can isolate \(v\)
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ \begin{equation} \begin{split} L_C^1 = V(\lambda_C) =
          v(rL_r+gL_g+bL_b)\\ v = \frac{V(\lambda_c)}{rL_r+gL_g+bL_b}
          \end{split} \end{equation} $$
        </div>
        <p>
          But what are the luminance of one unit of Red, Green, and Blue: \(L_r,
          L_g, L_b\)? Actually, we don't need the absolute luminance values,
          just their relative luminance is needed here. Here is what I mean.
          Without modifying the problem, we could have said that the factor $v$
          could instead be written as \(v = k\frac{1}{L_r}\). Equation (3)
          becomes
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ \begin{split} k\frac{1}{L_r} =
          \frac{V(\lambda_c)}{rL_r+gL_g+bL_b}\\ \end{split} $$
        </div>
        Now isolating $k$ gives $$
        <div class="block-equation">
          \begin{split} k = \frac{V(\lambda_c)}{\frac{1}{L_r}(rL_r+gL_g+bL_b)}\\
          =\frac{V(\lambda_c)}{(r\frac{L_r}{L_r}+g\frac{L_g}{L_r}+b\frac{L_b}{L_r})}\\
          = \frac{V(\lambda_c)}{(rL^r+gL^ g+bL^b)} \end{split} $$
        </div>
        with
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ \begin{split} L^r = \frac{L_r}{L_r} = 1\\ L^g = \frac{L_g}{L_r}\\
          L^b = \frac{L_b}{L_r}\\ \end{split} $$
        </div>
        <p>
          This change of variable illustrates that only the relative luminances
          are necessary. Those coefficients \(L^r, L^g, L^b\) are called the
          luminance coefficients. Injecting them in (2) gives this luminance
          equation involving the relative luminances.
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ \begin{equation} \begin{split} L_C^1=v(rL_r+gL_g+bL_b)\\ =

        </div>
        <p>
          But we are still missing \(L^g\) and \(L^b\) ! Wright measured that
          one unit of Green primary was about 4.4 times brighter than one unit
          of Red primary. And that one unit of blue primary was about 0.04 times
          less bright than one unit of Red. The exact value given by CIE are the
          following coefficients. If you are curious on how to find those
          coefficients, here is the <a href="TODO">procedure</a>.

        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ L^r = 1 \\ L^g = 4.4036 \\ L^b = 0.0471 $$
        </div>
        Let's generalize equation (4) for any spectral color \(\lambda\),
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} L^1(\lambda)
          &=k(\lambda)r(\lambda)L^r+k(\lambda)g(\lambda)L^g+k(\lambda)b(\lambda)L^b
          \end{aligned} \end{equation} $$
        </div>
        <p>
          which tells us that to match the luminance of 1 watt of a color whose
          chromaticity coefficients are \(r(\lambda), g(\lambda), b(\lambda)\),
          you need
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>\(\bar{r}(\lambda) = k(\lambda)r(\lambda)\) of Red Primary</li>
          <li>\(\bar{g}(\lambda) = k(\lambda)g(\lambda)\) of Green Primary</li>
          <li>\(\bar{b}(\lambda) = k(\lambda)b(\lambda)\) of Blue Primary</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Now you have it, the three Color Matching Functions
          \(\bar{r}(\lambda), \bar{g}(\lambda), \bar{b}(\lambda)\). To give a
          proper definition the CMF, \(\bar{r}(\lambda), \bar{g}(\lambda),
          \bar{b}(\lambda)\) represents the amount of Red, Green and Blue
          primary respectively, needed to match the spectral color
          \(C(\lambda)\) that emits 1 Watt of power. On the animation below, you
          can hover the color matching functions graph to see the mathematical
          relationship with the chromaticity coefficients and the photopic
          luminosity function \(V(\lambda)\).

          In the next section, we'll see how we can use those function to create
          any
          <span class="highlight">tristimulus values</span>, which are the three
          values used to describe any colors!
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="tristimulus-values">
        <h3>Tristimulus Values</h3>
        <p>
          Why are the CMF important? Remember at the beginning of this article,
          I suggested the idea that to create a color, we could just try to
          reproduce its SPD. I said that it was not realistic to take every
          monochromatic light with a different intensity to try to reproduce the
          SPD. But then we discovered the concept of metamerism. So actually
          only three monochromatic lights are needed to reproduce any colors. We
          just didn't know how to mix them together. Thanks to the CMF, now we
          know the amount of each primary required to match a specific SPD. To
          reproduce any color C (not just a spectral color) having a SPD
          \(\Phi(\lambda)\), the CMF tell us that we need those amount of
          primary:
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ R=\int{\Phi(\lambda)\bar{r}(\lambda)d\lambda} \\
          G=\int{\Phi(\lambda)\bar{g}(\lambda)d\lambda} \\
          B=\int{\Phi(\lambda)\bar{b}(\lambda)d\lambda} $$
        </div>
        Now, the color C characterized by SPD $\Phi(\lambda)$ is exactly matched
        in chromaticity and luminance by those amounts
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ C \triangleq R\mathcal{R}\hat{+}G\mathcal{G}\hat{+}B\mathcal{B} $$
        </div>
        <p>
          $R, G, B$ are called the tristimulus values of C. The tristimulus R,
          G, B of a color C are the amount of Red, Green and Blue primary
          respectively required to match the color C in chromaticity and
          luminance. Note that the mix R, G, B does not reproduce the SPD of C.
          They create a light whose color is perceived the same as the one of
          SPD \(\Phi(\lambda)\). In the animation below, you can select a color
          using the dropdown menu. You will see how its SPD is multiplied by the
          CMF. The area under each resulting curve represents the tristimulus
          values.
        </p>
        <div id="anim-tristimulus-from-spd" class="full-width-animation"></div>
        <p>
          With the tristimulus values, we have found a way to represent
          mathematically any color using three numbers. Remember that we said
          that a color is a specific cone response and that if we could find all
          the cone response, they would compose all the colors a human can
          perceive, i.e the Human Visual Gamut. The R, G, B tristimulus values
          are those cones response! It would be more correct to say that they
          are the attempt of Guild and Wright to represent the cone response. In
          an other chapter, we'll compare the real cone responses (L, M, S)
          found later by scientists to those tristimulus RGB. Since the
          tristimulus are 3 numbers, we can use them as dimensions on a 3D
          graph! Each axis will represent the amount of each primary. If you
          forgot what one unit of R primary is, it is the
          <i>look</i> of the Red Primary found during calibration! Our unit
          system is the one decided during calibration.
        </p>
        <h3>Graphical 3D representation of colors</h3>
        <p>
          Let's start to plot the tristimulus of the Spectral Colors
          corresponding of monochromatic lights that emit 1 one watt! Why?
          because we already have those tristimulus values, they are equivalent
          to the CMF! Remember that the CMF values are the amount of primary
          needed to match a monochromatic light emitting one watt.
          Mathematically, you could express the SPD of monochromatic light as
          dirac function \(\Phi(\lambda) = P_0\delta(\lambda-\lambda_0)\), with
          P0=1 watt. Therefore the tristimulus value of a monochromatic light of
          wavelength \(\lambda_m\) emitting 1 watt are given by
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ \begin{split}
          R_m=\int{\delta(\lambda-\lambda_m)\bar{r}(\lambda)d\lambda}=\bar{r}(\lambda_m)\\
          G_m=\int{\delta(\lambda-\lambda_m)\bar{g}(\lambda)d\lambda}=\bar{g}(\lambda_m)
          \\
          B_m=\int{\delta(\lambda-\lambda_m)\bar{b}(\lambda)d\lambda}=\bar{b}(\lambda_m)
          \end{split} $$
        </div>
        which mean that for each spectral color, we can take the value of the
        CMF as their tristimulus value. In the animation below, you can hover on
        each wavelength and see their corresponding tristimulus value on the 3d
        graph.
        <div class="full-width-animation" id="anim-cmf2graph3d"></div>
        <p>
          Fine, now we have the spectral colors, but what about the other
          colors? Remember when we talked about polychromaticity? You can
          combine monochromatic light to create other colors? Then
          mathematically, we can also express it in this 3D graph. Let's take
          the color Red an Green. If you mix half of both, you do the same for
          their tristimulus value and you will have a resulting color C. Name it
          as you want (maybe yellow?). But what your brain will perceive is a
          linear combination of both of the spectral color. On the graph you
          notice that it almost coincide with the yellow spectral color. Yes!
          Metamerism! In your brain, the response of the cones will be similar
          as the response given by monochromatic yellow light! So mixing red and
          green will give you the same response. But wait R, G, B are not the
          brain response right? You're right, but remember, according to the
          research of Thomas, Guild and Wright thought that each cone was more
          sensitive to one primary color, so they use the primary as a way to
          simulate the cone response. And later, when we were able to
          effectively compute the cone response (we'll talk later about LMS),
          the 3D graph will look very similar!!
        </p>
        <p>
          So by combining the monochromatic light with different weights, we are
          able to make the brain perceive other colors and we can plot them in
          the 3D graph. There is an infinity of combination possible, but some
          of them will give the same color! Taking two spectral colors and
          generating all the colors in between can already give us many colors,
          which as we can visualize on the animation, will give us an "envelope”
          of the Human Visual Gamut.
        </p>
        <div id="interpolate-tristimulus"></div>
        <p>
          Note that this envelope of generated color from the spectral colors
          are colors that would be perceived by a light emitting 1 watt! If you
          remember the general color matching equation using the tristimulus
          values
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ C \triangleq R\mathcal{R}\hat{+}G\mathcal{G}\hat{+}B\mathcal{B} $$
        </div>
        <p>
          If the luminance correspond to a light emitting 1 one of power, we can
          use the CMF as tristimulus values to write
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ C_1 \triangleq
          \bar{r}\mathcal{R}\hat{+}\bar{g}\mathcal{G}\hat{+}\bar{b}\mathcal{B}
          $$
        </div>
        <p>
          and for any other luminance $l$, you could simply scale each
          coefficient with the same factor $s$ to keep the same chromaticity
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ C_l = sC_1 \triangleq
          s\bar{r}\mathcal{R}+s\bar{g}\mathcal{G}+s\bar{b}\mathcal{B} $$
        </div>
        <p>
          Varying $s$ will vary the luminance of the color but keep the same
          chromaticity. Graphically, changing the luminance while keeping the
          chromaticity boils down to moving the tristimulus values on the
          <span class="highlight">isochromatic line</span>, a line of constant
          chromaticity.
        </p>
        <div
          id="anim-isochromatic-line-animation"
          class="full-width-animation"
        ></div>
        <p>
          Since you can increase the luminance indefinitely, there is actually
          no boundaries to be able to represent the Human Visual Gamut. The cone
          shape envelope we see is only a representation of equal-energy colors.
          However, the chromaticity of the Human Visual has boundaries. You'll
          better visualize those boundaries in the next section but we can
          already understand that because of those defined boundaries, we use
          the chromaticity diagram as a representation of the Human Visual
          Gamut.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we could say that the 3d volume is one sample of the Human Visual
          Gamut in a 3D space where each axis represent the amount of a primary
          light composing a color. Remember that the data I used are from the
          CIE. The actual primaries used for this representation are the Red at
          700nm, Green at 546.1nm and Blue at 435.8nm. And the sum of one unit
          of each primary will match the reference white E. Those primaries and
          reference white defined the 3D color space called the
          <span class="highlight">CIE 1931 RGB color space</span> (which is
          still neither the sRgb nor AdobeRGB color space!)

        <h3>Color Matching Experiment Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Here is a quick recap on the different step of the color matching
          experiment. By asking humans to match the spectral colors, we ended up
          by being able to represent the colors by three tristimulus values in a

          is the first color space called the CIE1931 RGB color space.

        <p>
          The next question is: how is the CIE1931 color space related to the
          horseshoe-shape chromaticity diagram? It is a 2d graph, not a 3d and
          the axis are x and y, not R, G nor B!

    <section id="the-chromaticity-diagram-finally">
      <h2>The Chromaticity Diagram (finally)</h2>
      <p>
        So far we've been able to understand that a color can be represented by
        its chromaticity coefficients and its luminance, and all the color a
        human can perceive are represented in a 3D volume with 3 axes R, G and
        B. Now it's good to recall the relationship between the different
        concepts through their mathematical notation.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>\(r, g, b\) : chromaticity coefficients</li>
        <li>\(\bar{r},\bar{g},\bar{b}\) : Color Matching Functions</li>
        <li>\(R, G, B\) : tristimulus values of a color</li>
        <li>\(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{B}\) : unit of Primary</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A color C represented by its SPD \(\Phi(\lambda)\) is fully matched in
        term of chromaticity and luminance using the tristimulus values:
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ C \triangleq R\mathcal{R}\hat{+}G\mathcal{G}\hat{+}B\mathcal{B} $$
      </div>
      where each tristimulus value are
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ R=\int{\Phi(\lambda)\bar{r}(\lambda)d\lambda} \\
        G=\int{\Phi(\lambda)\bar{g}(\lambda)d\lambda} \\
        B=\int{\Phi(\lambda)\bar{b}(\lambda)d\lambda} $$
      </div>
      <p>
        And from these tristimulus values, we can deduce the chromaticity
        coefficients because they are the relative amount primaries needed to
        produce a certain amount of this color C. In addition, they are defined
        such that their sum = 1.
      </p>
      <div class="block-equation">
        $$ r = \frac{R}{R+G+B} \\ g = \frac{G}{R+G+B} \\ b = 1-r-g $$
      </div>
      <p>
        If we represent the chromaticity coefficients in the RGB space, those
        points $r, g, b$ lies on the plane R+G+B =1, which is equivalent to
        project all the 3D visual gamut points onto this plane, along their line
        of constant chromaticity. By omitting b which can be found using r and
        g, you could visualize this plane in a 2D graph rg. This animation shows
        you the different projections. To make it the animation clearer, only
        the spectral colors are shown.
      </p>
      <div id="anim-RgbFrom3dTo2d"></div>
      <p>
        And there you have it, the chromaticity diagram. But it's still
        different than the one in the introduction! Be patient, we are almost
        there. This chromaticity diagram is expressed in the rg-plane while the
        one we are looking for is in the xy-plane. However, the xy-chromaticity
        diagram is actually the same this rg-chromaticity diagram but coming
        from a other color space created by CIE, the CIE1931 XYZ color space,
        which is a simple linear transformation of the CIE1931 RGB color space.
        Why not use the CIE1931 RGB? Because CIE wanted a standard color space
        where the colors could be expressed only with positive values. On top of
        that, they wanted one of the dimensions to represent the luminance.

        <h3>From CIE1931 RGB to CIE1931 XYZ</h3>
        <p>
          Remembering a bit of linear algebra, you know that to transform the
          coordinates of a point into another coordinate system, you need a
          transformation matrix that maps the axis of one of the system to the
          other one. Mathematically, the tristimulus values (R, G, B) in the RGB
          space defined by the three axis $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G},
          \mathcal{B})$ (the primaries) system can be expressed in the
          coordinate system defined by three other
          axis\(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y},\mathcal{Z}\) and have coordinate (X, Y,
          Z).
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ \begin{bmatrix} X \\ Y \\ Z \end{bmatrix} = M \begin{bmatrix} R \\
          G \\ B \end{bmatrix} $$
        </div>
        with
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ M = \begin{bmatrix} 0.49 & 0.31 & 0.20 \\ 0.17697 & 0.81240 &
          0.01063 \\ 0.00 & 0.01 & 0.99 \end{bmatrix} $$
        </div>
        <p>
          How did we find this matrix? and how was this new coordinate system X,
          Y, Z chosen? You'll find all the details <a href="">here</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The important point is that in this new system, all tristimulus values
          will be positive and the Y component represents the luminance of the
          color. In the XYZ space using primaries
          \(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y},\mathcal{Z}\), a color (chromaticity and
          luminance) of coordinates \((X, Y,Z)\) is now expressed as
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ C \triangleq X\mathcal{X}\hat{+}Y\mathcal{Y}\hat{+}Z\mathcal{Z} $$
        </div>
        <p>
          And again, the chromaticity coefficients are the relative amount of
          primaries chosen such that their sum = 1.
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ x = \frac{X}{X+Y+Z} \\ y = \frac{Y}{X+Y+Z} \\ z = 1-x-y $$
        </div>
        <p>
          Similarly as we did in the CIE1931 RGB space, we can plot the (X, Y,
          Z) tristimulus values simply by transforming the tristimulus (R, G, B)
          thanks to the matrix M.
        </p>
        <p>
          if we project those points along their line of isochromaticity on the
          plane X+Y+Z=1, we obtain the chromaticity coefficients (x, y, z). Then
          by omitting z which is dependent of x and y, we obtain on the XY-plane
          the famous horseshoe shape diagram. If we transfer those coordinates
          in a 2d graph with x and y label, we finally obtain our
          <span class="highlight">xy-chromaticity diagram</span>!
        </p>
        <div id="anim-cieRGBtoXYZ"></div>
        <p>
          Remember I've only projected the spectral colors, this is why the
          chromaticity diagram seems "empty”. This projection draws the
          boundaries of the chromaticity diagram and is called the
          <span class="highlight">spectral locus</span>. If we would have taken
          more points in the 3d volume we would have had more points and the
          shape would start to fill in. But we can also work directly on the 2d
          chromaticity diagram itself. To add more chromaticity we need to
          generate other colors. As seen previously (when filling the volume
          between two colors), mixing colors to produce an other color consists
          in summing up their tristimulus value.
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ \begin{split} C_1 \triangleq X_1\mathcal{X} \hat{+} Y_1\mathcal{Y}
          \hat{+} Z_1\mathcal{Z}\\ C_2 \triangleq X_2\mathcal{X} \hat{+}
          Y_2\mathcal{Y} \hat{+} Z_2\mathcal{Z}\\ C_r \triangleq C_1+C_2

        </div>
        <p>
          During this addition, what happens to the chromaticity coefficients.
          Do they also add up? Let's take the x chromaticity coordinate.
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ \begin{split} x_r &= \frac{X_r}{X_r+Y_r+Z_r}\\ &=
          \frac{X_1+X_2}{X_1+X_2+Y_1+Y_2+Z_1+Z_2} \end{split} $$
        </div>
        Using the chromaticity of C1 and C2,
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ X_1 = x_1(X_1+Y_1+Z_1)\\ X_2 = x_2(X_2+Y_2+Z_2) $$
        </div>
        Substituting in (…), and posing \(L_1 = (X_1+Y_1+Z_1)\) and
        \(L_2=(X_2+Y_2+Z_2)\), we end up with
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ \begin{split} x_r = \frac{X_r}{X_r+Y_r+Z_r} = \frac{L_1x_1 +
          L_2x_2}{L_1+L_2} \end{split} $$
        </div>
        This equation show the relation between the chromaticities. When mixing
        two colors, the resulting chromaticity is a weighted sum of their
        respective chromaticity.
        <p>
          Now, back to our chromaticity diagram. Remember that it is a
          projection of the plane X+Y+Z = 1. Therefore, to represent the
          chromaticity of \(C_r\), we have to constraint \(L_1+L_2 = 1\). We can
          rewrite equation (…) with this constraint and do the same development
          for the y-coordinate.
        </p>
        <div class="block-equation">
          $$ \begin{split} x_r = L_1x_1 + (1-L_1)x_2\\ y_r = L_1y_1 + (1-L_1)y_2

        </div>
        <p>
          According to this equation, if you take two color on the spectral
          locus and you combine them, the line in between represent the
          chromaticity of the colors resulting in mixing the spectral colors
          with different amount. Here an animation illustrating this
          computation.

          The chromaticities between minLambda and maxLambda which close the
          shape is called the line of purple! It's not part of the spectral
          locus since those colors does not correspond spectral colors. Each
          point inside this shape has coordinate (x, y) and represent the
          chromaticity of a colors. Since multiple colors have the same
          chromaticity, you could arbitraly decide which colors of chormaticity
          (x, y) you want plot. Usually, we use the color with the maximum
          luminance possible given by your device.

        <h3>Playing with chromaticity and luminance</h3>
        <p>
          Remember that a color can be characterized by its two attributes: its
          chromaticity and its luminance. And now you know that the chromaticity
          is given by the coordinates (x, y) in the chromaticity diagram. And
          the luminance is the Y component in the XYZ color space. In the
          animation below, you can create any color by choosing the chromaticity
          on the diagram and the luminance by changing the Y component. As
          expected, changing the luminance while keeping the same chromaticity
          will move you along the isochromatic line represented in the 3D graph.
